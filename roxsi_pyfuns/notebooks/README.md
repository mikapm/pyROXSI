# Analysis notebooks

The Jupyter notebooks in this directory contain more and less successful attempts at data analysis. Of main interest to others is probably the [article1_figures.ipynb](article1_figures.ipynb) notebook, which contains code to re-create all figures in the JGR manuscript focused on the Asilomar 2022 small-scale array analysis. Other notable notebooks include the [phase_resolved_diss.ipynb](phase_resolved_diss.ipynb) and [phase_resolved_diss_sensitivity.ipynb](phase_resolved_diss_sensitivity.ipynb) notebooks, which provide examples of how to estimate turbulence dissipation rates using the phase-resolved approach described in the JGR manuscript.
